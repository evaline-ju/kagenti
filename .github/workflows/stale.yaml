# Stale Issue and PR Management
#
# Automatically marks issues and PRs as stale after 60 days of inactivity,
# then closes them after a 14-day grace period. This keeps the backlog
# focused and encourages timely resolution.
#
# Exempt labels:
#   - Issues: 'high priority', 'bug' (never auto-closed)
#   - PRs: 'high priority' (never auto-closed)
#
# Token Requirements:
# - No external tokens needed
# - Uses GITHUB_TOKEN for issue/PR management
